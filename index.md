## Implementation Guidelines

### Assessment and Tracking
- **Individual Progress Tracking:** Each student maintains a personal checklist tracking progress through each level
- **Mentor Review:** All level completions require mentor verification and sign-off
- **Peer Assessment:** Include peer review components for leadership and communication tasks
- **Portfolio Development:** Students maintain portfolios documenting learning and achievements

### Prerequisites and Pathways
- **Flexible Pathways:** Students can work on multiple modules based on interest and aptitude
- **Cross-Module Integration:** Advanced tasks require coordination across multiple disciplines
- **Prerequisite Enforcement:** Students must have foundational skills before advancing
- **Accelerated Paths:** Advanced students may skip levels with demonstrated competency
