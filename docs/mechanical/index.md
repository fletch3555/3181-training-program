# Mechanical Systems Training

This module provides comprehensive training in mechanical engineering principles and mechanism design for FRC team members. Students will progress from basic mechanical concepts to advanced systems integration and optimization.

## Training Levels

### [Level 1: Mechanical Fundamentals](level-1)
Master basic mechanical principles, tool safety, and simple mechanism design while developing proper documentation habits.

### [Level 2: Advanced Mechanisms](level-2)
Design and analyze complex mechanisms, integrate power transmission systems, and apply engineering calculations to design decisions.

### [Level 3: System Integration](level-3)
Create complete mechanical subsystems, optimize designs for performance, and coordinate integration with other subsystems.

### [Level 4: Mechanical Architecture](level-4)
Lead mechanical design teams, develop system architecture, and optimize complete robot mechanical systems.
