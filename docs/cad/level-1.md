# CAD Level 1: Fundamentals

## Learning Objective
{: .learning-objective}
Master the CAD software interface and navigation, create fully-constrained 2D sketches using geometric and dimensional constraints, generate basic 3D parts through extrusion and modification features, and establish proper file management practices for collaborative design work.

## Prerequisites
{: .prerequisites}
None

## Tasks

### 1. Interface Navigation
{: .task-group}
- [ ] Complete software orientation tutorial
- [ ] Navigate all major toolbars and menus without assistance
- [ ] Customize workspace for efficient workflow
- [ ] Demonstrate keyboard shortcuts for 10 common commands

### 2. 2D Sketching Mastery
{: .task-group}
- [ ] Create fully constrained sketches using lines, circles, arcs
- [ ] Apply geometric constraints (parallel, perpendicular, tangent)
- [ ] Use dimensional constraints accurately
- [ ] Sketch validation: create 5 different fully-defined sketches

### 3. Basic 3D Features
{: .task-group}
- [ ] Create extrusions from 2D sketches
- [ ] Perform cuts and holes
- [ ] Apply fillets and chamfers
- [ ] Complete project: design simple bracket with mounting holes

### 4. File Management
{: .task-group}
- [ ] Organize parts in logical folder structure
- [ ] Use proper naming conventions
- [ ] Save and version control files appropriately
- [ ] Export files in multiple formats (STEP, STL, PDF)

## Assessment Criteria
- Complete all checklist items with mentor verification
- Pass software orientation certification
- Successfully create a fully-defined bracket project
- Demonstrate proper file organization
