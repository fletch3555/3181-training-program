# CAD Level 4: Full Robot Integration

**Learning Objective:** Lead comprehensive robot design architecture from concept through manufacturing, coordinate multi-disciplinary design teams across mechanical, electrical, and programming domains, perform advanced engineering analysis including FEA stress analysis and center of gravity calculations, manage design iterations based on testing feedback, and create complete manufacturing documentation while mentoring junior designers and maintaining design knowledge transfer systems.

## Tasks

### 1. System Architecture
- [ ] Develop overall robot architecture
- [ ] Coordinate multiple subsystem designs
- [ ] Manage design timeline and milestones
- [ ] Lead design reviews with entire team

### 2. Advanced Analysis
- [ ] Perform stress analysis on critical components
- [ ] Analyze center of gravity and stability
- [ ] Optimize for weight and performance
- [ ] Validate electrical clearances and EMI considerations

### 3. Manufacturing Coordination
- [ ] Generate complete manufacturing documentation
- [ ] Coordinate with Machining Level 3+ students
- [ ] Plan manufacturing sequence and dependencies
- [ ] Create assembly instructions and procedures

### 4. Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Implement design changes based on testing
- [ ] Maintain design history and rationale
- [ ] Mentor lower-level CAD students
- [ ] Document lessons learned for future seasons
