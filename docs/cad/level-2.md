## Learning Objective
{: .learning-objective}
Create complex 3D parts using advanced modeling features (revolve, sweep, loft, patterns), build multi-part assemblies with proper mate constraints and interference checking, apply design for manufacturing principles including tolerances and standard fasteners, and generate technical drawings with dimensions and annotations.

## Prerequisites
{: .prerequisites}
- [CAD Level 1](../cad/level-1)
- [Mechanical Level 1](../mechanical/level-1)

## Tasks

### 1. Advanced Part Features
{: .task-group}
- [ ] Create revolved features
- [ ] Use sweep and loft operations
- [ ] Apply patterns (linear, circular, feature-driven)
- [ ] Design project: create wheel with spokes using multiple features

### 2. Assembly Creation
{: .task-group}
- [ ] Insert parts into assembly
- [ ] Apply mate constraints (coincident, concentric, parallel)
- [ ] Check for interferences
- [ ] Create assembly: simple gearbox with 4+ parts

### 3. Design for Manufacturing
{: .task-group}
- [ ] Apply appropriate tolerances
- [ ] Consider manufacturing constraints
- [ ] Design for standard fasteners
- [ ] Validate designs against FRC rules and size constraints

### 4. Documentation Basics
{: .task-group}
- [ ] Create dimensioned drawings
- [ ] Add section views and detail views
- [ ] Include material specifications
- [ ] Generate bill of materials

## Assessment Criteria
- Complete all checklist items with mentor verification
- Successfully create wheel project with complex features
- Assemble functional gearbox with proper constraints
- Generate complete technical documentation package
